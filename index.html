        <div></div>
        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and study in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however I got it naturally. Reading good books keeps one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
